    <p>
      I have seven years of experience in traditional and digital marketing and a bachelor of arts in media communications from North Central University. I received a certification in full-stack web development from the University of Minnesota in October 2022. I’ve developed front-end skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working with APIs, and I’m continuing to refine back-end development skills. I value hard work, clear communication, and I admire organizations that are invested in their team members as much as they are focused on their goals.
